InterLex is a EU-funded project coordinated by the University of Turin, involving five European-wide academic institutions, a software development company specialising in legal informatics, and a Lawyers Association. The aim of the two-year project, which started in September 2018, is to develop a platform for providing information, decision support and training on private international law.
